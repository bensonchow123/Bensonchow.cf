<span>After getting accepted to the gpt-3 api open beta, I started brainstorming ideas in which I can utilize the api
    for a project, and I finally settled on the idea of a gpt-3 romantic partner.
</span>

    <span class="lb"><b>How does this work?</b></span>
    <ul>
        <li>First I fine turned gpt-3 davinci with a text prompt</li>
        <li>By using tkinter, a texting ui will be created for the conversation</li>
        <li>After entering a message, the bot will respond and the conversation is recorded in the ui</li>
    </ul>
    <span class="lb"><b>What will I need to do:</b></span>
    <ul>
        <li>Train a tensor flow ai to identify test content if a user want a picture</li>
        <li>Scape reddit api for picture depending on the message from the user</li>
    </ul>
