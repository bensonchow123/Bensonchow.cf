    <span>Our science class got a secret santa event, and I was deciding on a new project, and decided that I will create a
        website inspired by google gravity as a gift.
    </span>
    <span class="lb"><b>Backend</b></span>
    <ul>
        <li>Used a domain from Freenom registered in Gabon</li>
        <li>Uses Cloudflare as a CDN for faster loading</li>
        <li>Hosted with Github pages as a Jekyll site</li>
    </ul>
    <span class="lb"><b>Frontend</b></span>
    <ul>
        <li>Uses the Google gravity Javascript</li>
        <li>Uses css and javascript so the Google gravity logic can work on text and videos</li>
        <li>Make my site be able to dynamically create elements that uses the Google gravity logic</li>
    </ul>
