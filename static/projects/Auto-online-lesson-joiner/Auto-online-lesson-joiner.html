    <span><b>How does this work?<br></b>
    </span>


    <ol type = "1">
         <li>First i made a local sqlite database where I put my time table in</li>
         <li>Then selenium opens chrome and goto teams</li>
         <li>login with teams</li>
         <li>then for every 30 second, check if the current time is >= lesson time</li>
         <li>if it is a lesson time, it will open the class menu and click go on to the main chat</li>
         <li>then for every minute for 15 minute, it will search for a join button</li>
         <li>it will click the join buttons then mute and turn of camera if a join button is found</li>
         <li>and then it will leave in 55 minutes and start the entire thing again</li>
    </ol>
    <span>This is one of the reasons why my test scores are low during lock down</span>
