<div>
    <span>I got board during lock down when I decided to create a motion detector with my laptop camera.</span>

    <span class="lb"><b>How does this work?</b></span>
    <ul>
        <li>It gets video input from my laptop camera</li>
        <li>For every 0.5 second, it saves a frame and compares with the next frame</li>
        <li>If the pixel change detected is over a certain threshold</li>
        <li>An alarm will be played</li>
    </ul>
